Planto
## Description :
Planto, is designed for plant enthusiasts who want a streamlined way to care for their plants. It allows users to set and manage reminders for each plant's specific needs, such as watering schedules, light requirements, and location within their home
## Features :
- Reminders: 
Users can create, save, and customize reminders with fields like plant name, room location, light level, watering frequency, and water amount. Saved reminders are displayed on a main reminder page for easy access.
- Checking Reminders: 
Users can check reminders off as they’re completed, helping them stay on top of care routines and see which tasks are still pending.
- Clear Completion Feedback:
When all reminders are completed, a full-screen 'Well Done' page provides positive reinforcement and automatically clears completed reminders to make way for new ones.
